# Shenzhen-Solitaire-Pico8-Mirror
A mirror of HunterX's port of Shenzhen Solitaire to the Pico8 platform from https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=30310.

>After receiving my copy of the [official MS-DOS version of Shenzhen Solitaire](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1812249267/shenzhen-solitaire-for-ms-dos), I was inspired to try my hand at moving it to yet another platform!

>To win, stack the three suits from 1 to 9 in the top right. Stack cards in the center area, alternating suits and decreasing values. The free cells in the top left can store one card each of any type, or use the relevant button when four matching dragons are exposed to move them all to a free cell.

>Use the arrow keys to navigate, O (default Z) to make a selection and X (default X) to go back. Use the reset option in the pause menu if you wish to start again. If you enjoyed this game, please consider supporting the [original version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570490/SHENZHEN_SOLITAIRE) or its parent game, [Shenzhen I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/).
